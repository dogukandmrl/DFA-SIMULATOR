#DFA-SIMULATOR
It is a special case of finite automata. This special case should include the following 3 cases:

The condition to go from each state (State) shows a single state. In other words, it is possible to go to only one state with a word when going from one state to another.
Accepting a single final state for any input (not accepting more than one ending state at the same time)
Absence of the word lambda (or epsilon) in the transition between states
This project will work
